Neural networks progress by time simulation

# About

Some people argue that neural networks will develop endlessly and their development will lead to the emergence of a technological singularity.

I argue that this is not so, and the main factor preventing this is the limitation of data generated by humans, or rather by all of humanity.

This is important because neural networks cannot learn well from data generated by the neural network. Training neural networks on data created by the neural network leads to the accumulation of errors and, accordingly, the degradation of new neural networks. This simulation clearly shows this effect
